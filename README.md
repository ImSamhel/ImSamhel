Hi, I'm ImSamhel
- I’m a Software Engineer at day adn a hobbyist at night
- Striving to never write or touch spaghetti code 
- I really like Cyberpunk-style UIs
- My main domains are java and kotlin, but
- I'm also at home when it comes to all kinds of software topics and technologies, including: gamedev, compose, react, minecraft - fabric (somewhat), android (somewhat), c++
- My goals are beyond even my own understanding
